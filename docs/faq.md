## Architecture & Code & Principles

###  Why is gnet so fast?

gnet's networking model is a `Reactor` networking model with a event-driven mechanism that is designed and tuned to manage millions of network connections and handle a zillion requests, which backs gnet up to be the fatest networking framework in Go, and all it takes is a few goroutines.

In addition to the first-class networking model, the implementation of auto-scaling and reusable elastic buffers in gnet is also one of the critical essentials for its high performance.

..., etc.

## Stability

### Is gnet solid enough to be used in production?

Sure it is! 

Actually, there are already many companies/organizations using `gnet` as the underlying network service in production and they have been worked well for a long time.

Here is a partial list of gnet use cases: https://gnet.host/#usecases.

..., etc.

## Scope of application

### When should I use gnet instead of the standard net in Go?

`gnet` sells itself as a high-performance, lightweight, non-blocking, event-driven networking framework written in pure Go which works on transport layer with TCP/UDP protocols and Unix Domain Socket , so it allows developers to implement their own protocols(HTTP, RPC, WebSocket, Redis, etc.) of application layer upon `gnet` for building  diversified network applications, for instance, you get an HTTP Server or Web Framework if you implement HTTP protocol upon `gnet` while you have a Redis Server done with the implementation of Redis protocol upon `gnet` and so on.

`gnet` is not designed to displace the standard Go [net](https://golang.org/pkg/net/) package, but to create a networking client/server framework for Go that performs on par with [Redis](http://redis.io) and [Haproxy](http://www.haproxy.org) for networking packets handling (although it does not limit itself to these areas), therefore, `gnet` is not as comprehensive as Go [net](https://golang.org/pkg/net/), it only provides the core functionalities (by a concise API set) of a networking application and it is not planned on being a full-featured networking framework, as I think [net](https://golang.org/pkg/net/) has done a good enough job in this area.

In a word, if performance is not your top priority and you intend to take care of all corners during the networking development, then you should go with [net](https://golang.org/pkg/net/), but if you are trying to build a insanely fast networking application with a very low resource footprint and looking for a solution, I believe `gnet` is the right choice for you.

..., etc.
